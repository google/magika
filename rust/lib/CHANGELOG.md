# Changelog

## 0.1.0-rc.0

This version is the initial implementation and should be considered unstable. In particular, it
ships a new model in comparison to the Python binary and we would love feedback on
[GitHub](https://github.com/google/magika/issues).

## 0.0.0

This version is a placeholder and does not expose anything.
