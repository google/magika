[![OpenSSF Scorecard](https://api.securityscorecards.dev/projects/github.com/google/magika/badge)](https://securityscorecards.dev/viewer/?uri=github.com/google/magika) [![OpenSSF Best Practices](https://www.bestpractices.dev/projects/8706/badge)](https://www.bestpractices.dev/en/projects/8706) ![CodeQL](https://github.com/google/magika/workflows/CodeQL/badge.svg) [![PyPI Monthly Downloads](https://img.shields.io/pypi/dm/magika)](https://pypi.org/project/magika/)

Magika is a novel AI powered file type detection tool that relies on the recent advance of deep learning to provide accurate detection. Under the hood, Magika employs a custom, highly optimized Keras model that only weighs about a few MBs, and enables precise file identification within milliseconds, even when running on a single CPU.

In an evaluation with over 1M files and over 100 content types (covering both binary and textual file formats), Magika achieves 99%+ precision and recall. Magika is used at scale to help improve Google usersâ€™ safety by routing Gmail, Drive, and Safe Browsing files to the proper security and content policy scanners.
Read more in our [research paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13768)!

You can try Magika without installing anything by using our [web demo](https://google.github.io/magika/), which runs locally in your browser!

Here is an example of what Magika command line output look like:

## News

> [!IMPORTANT]
> We are about to release a number of new things, and they are ready for testing!
> - A new ML model with support for [200+ content types](./assets/models/standard_v2_1/README.md).
> - A new CLI written in Rust. This will replace the previous CLI written in python. More information [here](./rust/cli/README.md). The Rust codebase can also be used for applications written in rust, see the [docs](https://docs.rs/magika/0.1.0-rc.1/magika/index.html).
> - Python package 0.6.0rc1: this version ships the new model with support for 200+ content types, the CLI written in Rust (which replaces the old one written in python), and a revamped Python API with a few breaking changes, see the [docs](./python/README.md) and the [changelog](./python/CHANGELOG.md)!
> If you need docs about the stable release, browse this repository at the latest stable tag, [here](https://github.com/google/magika/tree/python-v0.5.1).


## Highlights

- Available as a command line tool written in Rust, a Python API, a Rust API, and an experimental TFJS version (which powers our [web demo](https://google.github.io/magika/)).
- Trained on a dataset of over 25M files across more than 100 content types.
- On our evaluation, Magika achieves 99%+ average precision and recall, outperforming existing approaches.
- More than 200 content types (see [full list](./assets/models/standard_v2_1/README.md)).
- After the model is loaded (this is a one-off overhead), the inference time is about 5ms per file.
- Batching: You can pass to the command line and API multiple files at the same time, and Magika will use batching to speed up the inference time. You can invoke Magika with even thousands of files at the same time. You can also use `-r` for recursively scanning a directory.
- Near-constant inference time independently from the file size; Magika only uses a limited subset of the file's bytes.
- Magika uses a per-content-type threshold system that determines whether to "trust" the prediction for the model, or whether to return a generic label, such as "Generic text document" or "Unknown binary data".
- Support three different prediction modes, which tweak the tolerance to errors: `high-confidence`, `medium-confidence`, and `best-guess`.
- It's open source! (And more is yet to come.)

For more details, see the documentation for the [python package](./python/README.md) and for the [js package](./js/README.md) (dev [docs](./docs/js.md)).

### Running in Docker

```
git clone https://github.com/google/magika
cd magika/
docker build -t magika .
docker run -it --rm -v $(pwd):/magika magika -r /magika/tests_data
```

#### Python API

Examples:

```python
>>> from magika import Magika
>>> m = Magika()
>>> res = m.identify_bytes(b"# Example\nThis is an example of markdown!")
>>> print(res.output.label)
markdown
```


See [python documentation](./python/README.md) for detailed documentation.


#### Experimental TFJS model & npm package

We also provide Magika as an experimental package for people interested in using in a web app.
Note that Magika JS implementation performance is significantly slower and you should expect to spend 100ms+ per file.

See [js documentation](./docs/js.md) for the details.


## Development Setup

See the "Development Setup" section in the [python docs](./python/README.md).

## Known Limitations & Contributing

Magika significantly improves over the state of the art, but there's always room for improvement! More work can be done to increase detection accuracy, support for additional content types, bindings for more languages, etc.

This initial release is not targeting polyglot detection, and we're looking forward to seeing adversarial examples from the community.
We would also love to hear from the community about encountered problems, misdetections, features requests, need for support for additional content types, etc.

Check our open GitHub issues to see what is on our roadmap and please report misdetections or feature requests by either opening GitHub issues (preferred) or by emailing us at magika-dev@google.com.

**NOTE: Do NOT send reports about files that may contain PII, the report contains (a small) part of the file content!**

See [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md) for details.
