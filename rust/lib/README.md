# Magika

This library crate provides file type detection with deep-learning. A command-line interface (CLI)
for this library is provided by the [magika-cli](https://crates.io/crates/magika-cli) binary crate.

This `magika` library and the `magika-cli` binary are still unstable (as indicated by the major
version of zero) and new versions might introduce breaking changes (all changes will follow [cargo
semver compatibility](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/semver.html)). In particular,
version 0.1.0-rc.0 ships a new model in comparison to the Python binary and we would love feedback
on [GitHub](https://github.com/google/magika/issues).
