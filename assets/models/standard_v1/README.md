# Model documentation

The list of supported content types is indicated by the `target_labels_space` list in the model config, which you can find [here](https://github.com/google/magika/blob/7f947319f1ebe09626368a3f989a0863fcd7c52a/assets/models/standard_v1/model_config.json#L440-L554).

Note: This model will be deprecated soon, in favor of more recent models (e.g., `standard_v3_x`).
