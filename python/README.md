Magika is a novel AI-powered file type detection tool that relies on the recent advance of deep learning to provide accurate detection. Under the hood, Magika employs a custom, highly optimized model that only weighs about a few MBs, and enables precise file identification within milliseconds, even when running on a single CPU. Magika has been trained and evaluated on a dataset of ~100M samples across 200+ content types (covering both binary and textual file formats), and it achieves an average ~99% accuracy on our test set.

Use Magika as a command line client or in your Python code!

You can find more information on which content types are supported, extended documentation, and bindings for other languages on our GitHub project at [https://github.com/google/magika](https://github.com/google/magika).

> The `magika` Python package is suitable for production use. However, because it's currently in its zero major version (`0.x.y`), future `0.x+1.z` updates may include breaking changes (more in general, Magika adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html)). For detailed information and migration guidance, please refer to the [`CHANGELOG.md`](https://github.com/google/magika/blob/main/python/CHANGELOG.md).

> **IMPORTANT**: This latest 0.6.1 version has a few breaking changes from the latest stable version, 0.5.1. Please consult the [CHANGELOG.md](https://github.com/google/magika/blob/main/python/CHANGELOG.md#061---2025-03-19) and the [migration guide](https://github.com/google/magika/blob/main/python/CHANGELOG.md#breaking-changes-and-migration-guide).

## Installing Magika

Magika is available as `magika` on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/magika):

To install the most recent stable version:

```shell
$ pip install magika
```

If you intend to use Magika only as a command line, you may want to use `$ pipx install magika` instead.

If you want to test out the latest release candidate, you can install it with `pip install --pre magika`.

## Using Magika as a command-line tool

> Beginning with version `0.6.0`, the magika Python package includes a pre-compiled Rust-based command-line tool, replacing the previous Python version. This binary is distributed as platform-specific wheels for most common architectures. For unsupported platforms, a pure-Python wheel is also available, providing the legacy Python client as a fallback.

## Using Magika as a Python module

> Note: The Python API introduced in version `0.6.0` closely resembles the previous version, but includes several enhancements and a few breaking changes. Migrating existing clients should be relatively straightforward. Where possible, we have maintained compatibility with the old API and added deprecation warnings. For a complete list of changes and migration guidance, consult the [CHANGELOG.md](https://github.com/google/magika/blob/main/python/CHANGELOG.md).

Here is a few examples on how to use the `Magika` Python module:

```python
>>> from magika import Magika
>>> m = Magika()
>>> res = m.identify_bytes(b'function log(msg) {console.log(msg);}')
>>> print(res.output.label)
javascript
```

```python
>>> from magika import Magika
>>> m = Magika()
>>> res = m.identify_path('./tests_data/basic/ini/doc.ini')
>>> print(res.output.label)
ini
```

```python
>>> from magika import Magika
>>> m = Magika()
>>> with open('./tests_data/basic/ini/doc.ini', 'rb') as f:
>>>     res = m.identify_stream(f)
>>> print(res.output.label)
ini
```

## Documentation on core concepts

To get the most out of Magika, it's worth learning about its core concepts. You can read about the models, prediction modes, output structure, and content type knowledge base in the documentation [here](https://github.com/google/magika/blob/main/docs/concepts.md).

### API documentation

First, create a `Magika` instance: `magika = Magika()`.

The constructor accepts the following optional arguments:

- `model_dir`: path to a model to use; defaults to the latest available model.
- `prediction_mode`: which prediction mode to use; defaults to `PredictionMode.HIGH_CONFIDENCE`.
- `no_dereference`: controls whether symlinks should be dereferenced; defaults to `False`.

Once instantiated, the `Magika` object exposes methods to identify the content type of a `bytes` object, of files identified by their paths, and of an already-open binary stream:

- `magika.identify_bytes(b"test")`: takes as input a stream of bytes and predict its content type.
- `magika.identify_path("test.txt")`: takes as input one `str | os.PathLike` object and predicts its content type.
- `magika.identify_paths(["test.txt", "test2.txt"])`: takes as input a list of `str | os.PathLike` objects and returns the predicted type for each of them.
- `magika.identify_stream(stream: typing.BinaryIO)`: takes as input an _already open_ binary file-like object (e.g., the output of `open(file_path, 'rb')`) and returns its predicted content type. Keep in mind that Magika will `seek()` around the stream, and that the stream _is not closed_ (closing is the responsibility of the caller).

If you are dealing with large files, the `identify_path`, `identify_paths`, and `identify_stream` variants are generally better: their implementation `seek()`s around the file/stream to extract the needed features, without loading the entire content in memory.

These API returns an object of type [`MagikaResult`](https://github.com/google/magika/blob/main/python/src/magika/types/magika_result.py), an [`absl::StatusOr`](https://abseil.io/docs/cpp/guides/status)-like wrapper around [`MagikaPrediction`](https://github.com/google/magika/blob/main/python/src/magika/types/magika_prediction.py), which exposes the same information discussed in the [Magika's output documentation](https://github.com/google/magika/blob/main/docs/concepts.md).

Here is how the main types look like:

```python
class MagikaResult:
    path: Path
    ok: bool
    status: Status
    prediction: MagikaPrediction
    dl: ContentTypeInfo  # Shortcut for `prediction.dl`, valid only for `status == Status.OK`
    output: ContentTypeInfo  # Same as above, shortcut to `prediction.output`
    score: float  # Same as above, shortcut to `prediction.float`
```

```python
class MagikaPrediction:
    dl: ContentTypeInfo
    output: ContentTypeInfo
    score: float
    # Specify why the model's output has been overwritten (if that's the case)
    overwrite_reason: OverwriteReason
```

```python
class ContentTypeInfo:
    label: ContentTypeLabel
    mime_type: str
    group: str
    description: str
    extensions: List[str]
    is_text: bool
```

```python
class ContentTypeLabel(StrEnum):
    APK = "apk"
    BMP = "bmp"
    [...]
```

### Additional APIs

- `get_output_content_types()`: Returns a list of all possible content type labels that Magika can output (i.e., the possible values of `MagikaResult.prediction.output.label`). This is the recommended method for most users that want to have a list of what is the output space of Magika.
- `get_model_content_types()`: Returns a list of all possible content type labels the _deep learning model_ can output (i.e., `MagikaResult.prediction.dl.label`). Useful for debugging, most users should refer to `get_output_content_types()`.
- `get_module_version()` and `get_model_version()`: Returns the module version and the model's name being used, respectively.

## Development setup

- `magika` uses `uv` as a project and dependency managment tool. To install all the dependencies: `$ cd python; uv sync`.
- To run the tests suite: `$ cd python; uv run pytest tests -m "not slow"`. Check the github action workflows for more information.
- We use the `maturin` backend to combine the Rust CLI with the python codebase in the `magika` python package. This process is automated via the [build python package GitHub action](https://github.com/google/magika/blob/main/.github/workflows/python-build-package.yml).
