### Go (In Progress)
A Go port of Magika is currently under development. While the implementation is largely complete, a few final steps are needed before it can be published as a package. You can explore the source code and track its progress on GitHub.

Source Code: github.com/google/magika/tree/main/go

### Other Languages

Official bindings for other languages are not yet available. However, since Magika's core is built in Rust, it can be integrated into many programming environments using a Foreign Function Interface (FFI). For example:

- Java (JVM): Integration should be possible using the Java Native Interface (JNI).

- .NET: Integration can be achieved using P/Invoke.

We encourage community contributions to create and maintain new bindings. If you are interested in developing one, please feel free to contact us to discuss it.
